The 3D print design is hardware specific for:

- [ICE40HX1K-EVB](https://www.olimex.com/wiki/ICE40HX1K-EVB) (Rev B)
- [Olimexino-32u4](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Duino/AVR/OLIMEXINO-32U4/open-source-hardware) (Rev B)
- [MOD-LCD2-8RTP](https://www.olimex.com/Products/Modules/LCD/MOD-LCD2-8RTP/open-source-hardware) (Rev D)

Other hardware revisions in the samer series probably also fine as long as the drill holes are the same (true for `MOD-LCD2-8RTP`, unconfirmed for others).

The `.STL` files are dimensionally accurate for PLA filament.

The `Cura` files show the printing supports and build plate orientation.

The `Fusion` files (Autodesk Fusion) allow design editing for alternative hardware.
