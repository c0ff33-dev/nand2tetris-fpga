* `00_Dev_Jig` contains a basic jig to clip the `olimexino-32u4`, `iCE40HX1K-EVB` & `MOD-LCD2.8RTP` and boards into place for easy access during development, the latter can be laid flat or rotated vertically for a "billboard" style effect. The boards are so light the pressure from the various cables tends to splay them out in random directions otherwise but this is completely optional.
* `01_Display_Case` similarly contains the original files for a display case/enclosure without the `olimexino-32u4` if you prefer a more complete/finished look.
