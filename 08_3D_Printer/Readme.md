# 3D printed case

Finally we print a case with a 3D printer. All the parts are modelled with free software tools.

- [blender](https://blender.org) is a very powerful 3D modelling software. All parts of the cube are modelled with blender. You can edit the blender files and change details on the design. The blender design files can than be exported to STL format, a common 3D file format used for 3D printing.
- [prusa-slic3r](https://www.prusa3d.com). This is the slicer software for 3D printers from the manufacturer Prusa. This program is used to convert the STL files to printer specific gcode files.

The subfolder `files/` containes the blender files, the corresponging STL files and the already sliced gcodes for Prusa-MK3S printer.
